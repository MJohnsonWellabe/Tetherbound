# Visual Parity Program — progress checkpoint

**This file is the single resume point for the Meadows visual-parity program**
(`docs/VISUAL_PARITY_STAGED_GOAL_PROMPT_V2.md`, `docs/TETHERBOUND_VISUAL_BIBLE_V2.md`).
A fresh session with only this file plus the repo must be able to continue.
Passes are `VP0…VP11` (visual passes) — never conflate with gameplay Gate A/B/….

## Branch and SHAs

| item | value |
|---|---|
| program branch | `claude/coordination-subagents-3fhz1x` (the owner prompt names `codex/meadows-visual-parity`; this session's harness pins the branch name, so this branch *is* the visual-parity branch — do not create a second one) |
| starting `main` SHA | `252ccc81` (2026-09-01, `origin/main` at program start) |
| current branch SHA | (updated at each pass, see per-pass table) |
| last successful push SHA | (see per-pass table) |

## Pass status

| pass | status | commit SHA | pushed SHA | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| VP-PRE | in progress | — | — | §VP-PRE below |
| VP0 baseline | pending | — | — | `ralph/reports/visual-parity/VP0-baseline/` |
| VP1 sky/light | pending | — | — | |
| VP2 terrain/ground | pending | — | — | |
| VP3 vegetation | pending | — | — | |
| VP4–VP11 | not started | — | — | |

**Current pass:** VP-PRE. **Next action:** (filled at end of each pass).

## VP-PRE — environment capability check

| check | result |
|---|---|
| 1. Godot binary + project imports | (pending) |
| 2. real screenshot file on disk from the repo capture path | (pending) |
| 3. image is a real rendered frame | (pending) |
| 4. test command runs | (pending) |
| 5. blind visual judge invocable from this environment | (pending) |

Environment notes for the next session (all verified 2026-09-01):
- Install Godot 4.7-stable: `tools/art_pipeline/setup.sh godot` → `~/.cache/tetherbound-art/godot`.
- Fresh container also needs: `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libegl1 libegl-mesa0 mesa-vulkan-drivers`
  (xvfb is preinstalled here) and `pip install pillow numpy` for `tools/frame_stats.py`.
- Import once (twice on a cold cache): `$GODOT --headless --path . --import`.
- Capture: `xvfb-run -a -s "-screen 0 1920x1080x24" $GODOT --path . --rendering-driver opengl3 --resolution 1920x1080 --script tools/<capture>.gd`.
  NEVER combine `--headless` with `--rendering-driver` (hangs forever, `ralph/conventions.md`).
- Tests: `$GODOT --headless --path . --script tests/run_tests.gd -- --only=<files>` and `tests/smoke_<name>.gd`.
- Blind judge: `.claude/skills/visual-judge/SKILL.md` — run as a fresh subagent given only the
  contact sheet, the frames and `docs/reference/`. Runnable here (Claude Code); record `DEFERRED` only if not.

## §6 acceptance numbers (PROVISIONAL — owner to confirm the placeholders)

| item | value |
|---|---|
| target platform | Windows / ROG Ally |
| renderer | Compatibility (`gl_compatibility`) |
| capture + measurement resolution | 1920x1080 for evidence frames; perf stands at 1280x720 (the repo's `tools/perf_render_stats.gd` series) |
| graphics preset | the shipped defaults: `project.godot` `[rendering]` (directional shadow 2048, positional atlas 2048, soft shadow filter 2, msaa_3d 2x) + `data/config/performance.json` as committed. There is no in-game preset system. |
| minimum sustained FPS | **45 (PROVISIONAL)** — cannot be measured in this container (software GL); owner measures on the Ally |
| minimum 1% low FPS | **30 (PROVISIONAL)** |
| container-enforced proxy per pass | `tools/perf_render_stats.gd`: primitives at `band1_open` ≤ 12.0M (baseline 9.25M with grass_field OFF; 31.7M produced the ~10 FPS owner report), draw calls at `band1_open` ≤ 7500, draw calls at `hall_approach` ≤ 4000 (`docs/PERFORMANCE_BUDGET.md` §0.5). Same tool, same resolution, every pass. |
| test command | `tests/smoke_art.gd`, `tests/smoke_playground.gd`, `tests/smoke_traversal.gd` + `run_tests.gd --only=` the tests owning changed files; full 4-shard unit suite at VP0 and at the end of VP3 |

## Performance measurements

(filled per pass; baseline in VP0)

## Judge history

(one entry per pass: verdict or DEFERRED, main failures, response)

## Implementation decisions

- `data/config/grass_field.json` stays **OFF**. Owner playtest 2026-09-01 measured ~10 FPS with it on
  (`ralph/reports/OWNER-0901-PERFORMANCE-LAG-V2.md`). All ground density in this program goes through the
  baked `Terrain3DInstancer` scatter (per-cell culling) with `scatter_lod_ranges` distance cutoffs, and is
  gated by the primitive proxy above.

## Regressions / unresolved problems

(none yet)

## Resume note

(written at the end of every pass)
