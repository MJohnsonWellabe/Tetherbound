## R0.3 — The ten comparison sheets
`5e0f1cc` · concept row over candidate rows, same four angles at one scale, plus
a blank scorecard with a HARD FAIL column per species. Meadowhart's sheet
confirms the `DROP_FOR_SPECIES` fix worked: all three candidates carry the
saddle, stirrup and leaf collar.

## R0.2 — `rig_bird.py` merged
`861c38a` · Proportion-driven bird armature emitting the roster's six standard
clips. Serves Reedwing, Pipwing, Duskhush and Galecrest. Written but **not yet
exercised on a real candidate** — R0.6 is its first real use, so treat its first
run as verification.

## R0.1 — The candidate models and renders are tracked
`1983352` · 26 GLBs and 104 renders force-added out of gitignored scratch
directories. They are 520 Meshy credits that cannot be regenerated on the 375
remaining. `assets_raw/.gdignore` added so Godot does not import them into the
Windows build.

## Pre-Ralph — the session that set this up

- **D17: an evolution is always larger**, with `tests/test_evolution_links.gd`
  enforcing it. Owner instruction.
- **Grading fixed.** One shared `grade.py` replaces three per-species scripts.
  Ripplet's clipped white 33.4% → 0.00%, Galewisp 28.5% → 0.00%, Ripplet's
  emissive (lighting 38% of itself) zeroed, Terrapup verified not to regress at
  0.36/255 outside the eye guard.
- **The sequence director written** — the file three places in the repo already
  claimed existed. Beat order driven from `opening.json`, not an enum.
- **`name_prompt.gd` did not parse** under Godot 4.7, so the naming panel was
  instantiating scriptless and beat 5 could never have worked. Found
  independently by two agents. Fixed.
- **The phantom party is gone.** `party_seam.gd` looked up `/root/GameState`
  against an autoload registered as `Game`, with a mismatched API, so it kept a
  second five-slot party beside the real one. A tautological assertion —
  `assert_true(answer or not answer)` — is why nothing ever said so.
- **Docs brought onto the wild-roster canon.** Ridgewolf and Terracrown retired,
  Mudsnout added, Tuskroot moved to the one evolution the biome has.
- **The negative prompt list stopped banning three creatures' own signatures** —
  a deer's long legs, a deer's saddle, an otter's paddle tail.
- **All ten species generated**: 895 → 375 credits, exactly the 520 planned, no
  re-rolls.

Suite went 247 → 277 tests over the session.
