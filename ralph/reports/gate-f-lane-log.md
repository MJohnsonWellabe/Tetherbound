# Gate F lane — stage-boundary log

This lane runs in its own container (session `tetherbound-2c`) and cannot reach
the coordinator session (`tetherbound-06`) by message — `ListAgents` shows no
cross-session peer from here, and a `SendMessage` to that name returns "no agent
reachable". The mandate requires a check-in at every stage boundary, so the
check-ins are written here instead, where they survive this container being
reclaimed and where the coordinator can read them off the branch.

Stages, per the lane mandate: instrumentation pushed/green -> candidate frozen
(with SHA) -> operator run complete -> provisional backlog hashed -> final
backlog published -> §17 remediation.

## Check-in 1 — 2026-08-25 — STAGE 1 (instrumentation build) STARTED

- Container prepped: `apt-get update` first (per the stale-index trap), then
  `libegl1 libegl-mesa0 mesa-vulkan-drivers xvfb`; Godot
  `4.7.stable.official.5b4e0cb0f` from `tools/art_pipeline/setup.sh godot`;
  `--headless --path . --import` building `.godot/`.
- Branch `ralph/GATE-F-INSTRUMENTATION` at `c196e18a` = `origin/main` `636673ce`
  plus Fable's completed Phase A commit.
- Developer subagent building `ralph/GATE_F_INSTRUMENTATION_REQUEST.md` in full:
  `tools/gate_f/operator_harness.gd`, `scripts/debug/gate_f_probe.gd`,
  `tools/gate_f/run_segment.sh`, `tools/gate_f/SEGMENT_SCHEMA.md`, tests.
  Prime directive enforced: no gameplay path changes behavior, accessors are
  additive and read-only, telemetry only under a CLI flag, telemetry reads live
  game state. No `vram` and no device-fps field exists in the schema at all.
- Phase A is NOT being redone. It is Fable's and it is done.

Nothing is pushed yet. When the branch is green it needs the coordinator's
`ralph-sweep.yml` dispatch — this lane does not push to `main` and does not open
pull requests.
