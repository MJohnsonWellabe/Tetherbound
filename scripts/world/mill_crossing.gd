## SE22 — the Old Mill Crossing, spec §3 Band 3's main gate.
##
## The one place SE21's river can be crossed. Team Tether has disabled the
## crossing and taken the person who knows the mechanism; freeing them (`SE27`)
## yields the Mill Bridge Gear, and the crossing opens for good. Everything
## about "shut, then permanently open, with no menu in between" is
## `gated_crossing.gd`'s and `item_gate.gd`'s (`SB10`) — this file adds the one
## thing this crossing has that the South Bridge does not: the mill.
##
## The mill is `building_prefabs.json`'s existing `mill`, the same recipe the
## village's own mill on the stream is built from (`village.json`,
## EV6-remainder) — D24's one village family, no new architecture for a second
## mill, and the wheel hangs over moving water here for the same reason it
## hangs over the stream there. Its position is authored in the crossing's own
## `mill` block, in the crossing's local frame, so it moves with the bridge if
## the narrows are ever re-sited.

## The catalogue stand is thirty-three metres down the ordinary south-bank
## road. The crossing used to reveal a tall house through a tree and nothing
## that said whether it belonged to the river, the road, or the bridge. A
## normal fingerpost at the work-yard entrance makes the authored name a
## physical part of that approach. It uses the same sign object and lettering
## as every Meadows route marker; this is not a floating label or new lore.

## The mill on the village-side bank. Placed in this node's own frame — local
## +X is the bridge's run toward the far bank, so the authored offset's x is
## negative to stand it back on the near side — and seated on the ground it
## actually finds there rather than on the deck's level, because the abutment
## pad and the mill yard are the same `flats` pad but the yard falls away from
## it (`terrain_playground.json`).
