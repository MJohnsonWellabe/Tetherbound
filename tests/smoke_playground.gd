extends SceneTree

## Runtime smoke check for the M1 playground.
##
##   godot --headless --path . --script tests/smoke_playground.gd
##
## Loads the real main scene, lets physics run, and asserts the things that
## would otherwise only be discovered by launching the game:
##
##   * the Terrain3D extension loaded and the baked data was found
##   * the player was placed ON the ground rather than inside or above it
##   * the player is standing on collision, not falling forever
##
## This is not a unit test and does not live under the `test_*` discovery glob,
## because it boots an entire scene and takes seconds rather than milliseconds.
## It is the closest thing to "does it actually run" that a headless machine
## can produce, and it is the check that would have caught a terrain bake that
## silently produced no collision.
